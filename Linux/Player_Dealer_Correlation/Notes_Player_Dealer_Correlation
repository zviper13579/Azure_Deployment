My findings have lead me to believe player Mylie Schmidt and dealer Billy Jones are colluding to scam Lucky Duck. I looked into the win/loss documents and filtered out all the losses on the dates specified: 03/10, 03/12, and 03/15. On those dates there was one player who played each time a loss to the company was recorded: Mylie Schmidt. After those findings I looked in the Dealer Schedule directory and filtered out the employees who worked at the same time losses were recorded. I discovered a pattern. Billy Jones worked those exact times. This can not be a coincidence.
